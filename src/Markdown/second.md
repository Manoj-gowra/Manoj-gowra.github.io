sentence : knowledge representation language
proposition symbols : P , Q , R
these represents some sentences or facts about the world
we want to connect propositonal symbols to connect someway
we use 
## Logical connectives

~not, ^and , or, implication , biconditional

implication : if P is true then Q also need to be true then only p implicatin q is true

               if P is false then we don't take consider the Q then implication is true

    

biconditional : if and only if

               

The above five logical connectives gives the core of the propositonal logic

### Model

assignes truth value to every proposional symbols
